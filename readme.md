## Description

The **Alphabet Soup Charity Optimization** project applies machine learning techniques to predict whether applicants will successfully receive funding. Using neural networks, the project optimizes models to improve prediction accuracy for charitable funding success.

The analysis is implemented in a **Jupyter Notebook** and focuses on data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using Python libraries like **TensorFlow** and **scikit-learn**.
