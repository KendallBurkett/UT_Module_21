## Description

The **Alphabet Soup Charity Optimization** project applies machine learning techniques to predict whether applicants will successfully receive funding. Using neural networks, the project optimizes models to improve prediction accuracy for charitable funding success.

The analysis is implemented in a **Jupyter Notebook** and focuses on data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using Python libraries like **TensorFlow** and **scikit-learn**.

## Features

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleans and prepares input data for training.
   - Encodes categorical features and scales numerical data.

2. **Neural Network Model**:
   - Builds a binary classification deep learning model using **TensorFlow/Keras**.
   - Trains and evaluates the model for performance.

3. **Model Optimization**:
   - Tests different architectures, including:
     - Layer adjustments
     - Neuron count variations
     - Activation functions
   - Saves the optimized model as `trained_model.h5`.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Reports accuracy and loss metrics.
   - Iteratively optimizes the model to improve performance.
